    <h2>C-arm Calibration & System Optimization</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead a data-driven initiative to improve system performance and operational efficiency by redesigning the C-arm calibration process.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams—including marketing, hardware, systems, and engineering—to define requirements and deliver a scalable calibration tool implemented in \textbf{Python}.</li>
        <li>Reduced installation time from over $8$ hours to under 2 hours and increased system performance pass rate from under $20\%$ to over $80\%$, directly improving product efficiency and customer satisfaction. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Intra-Operative Image Alignment (IOA)</h2>. 
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a data pipeline to align intra-operative surgical images with high precision ($\leq 5$ mm, $\leq 3°$), enhancing clinical decision-making during procedures.</li>
        <li>Partnered with cross-functional teams—including regulatory, product, and engineering—to drive the FDA 510(k) submission and successfully launch the IOA system’s alpha release.</li>
        <li>Designed and deployed a statistical monitoring tool to evaluate system performance in the field within 20 minutes, enabling scalable and consistent QA across hospital sites.</li>
    </ul>
